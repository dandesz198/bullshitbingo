## About the game

This project is created by @dandesz198.

Imagine the endless possibilities of creating a bingo game about anything. Who's going to marry next, what's the next thing that's going to break in the office, etc.
Well, that's what Bullshit Bingo is about.
Create a match, share it with your friends, and play together freely.

## Rules of the game

* You can only vote on 2 cards in one game
* Only the adminds (room or match masters) can delete cards and give points (via 'Bingo!' button)
* The room master can kick anyone
* Both the kicked players and the quitters can rejoin every match
* Once the room master exits, the game is going to be deleted, permanently.
* Have fun! ;)
